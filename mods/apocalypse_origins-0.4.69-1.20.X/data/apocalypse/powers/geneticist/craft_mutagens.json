	"description": "You know how to create mutagens which exploit the unpredictable and unscientific properties of Lapis Lazuli.\n \nWhen used on someone other than yourself: Trigger [Injection Cooldown]. You can not inject that creature for 30 seconds.\n \n- When used on some mob types, you can change them into a variant version of themselves.\n \n- Upon use on a player, it rerolls every active [Side Effect] within the recipient and then breaks. If the player is a geneticist who is not under the effects of [Antimutagens], their [Innate Genes] will also be rerolled. If a player does not have any active [Side Effects], they will receive two random active [Side Effects]. If the recipient is sneaking, you will instead delete a single random [Side Effect] or generic [Gene]. There's a chance this secondary property will fail!",
