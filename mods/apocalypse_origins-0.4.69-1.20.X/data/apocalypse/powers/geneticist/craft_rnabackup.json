	"description": "Extracting genes is an arduous task, and losing them is a hindrance to your research. You reckon you could repurpose these unscientific totems the evokers use to create a backup or sorts...\n \nUpon use, every [Gene] and [Side Effect] within a player becomes protected. The RNA Backup then breaks. A protected [Gene] or [Side Effect] wonâ€™t reset on death. Protection wears off after one respawn, as the RNA is copied into DNA and needs to be replicated again.",
