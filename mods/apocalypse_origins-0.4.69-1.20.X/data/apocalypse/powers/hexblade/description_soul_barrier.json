	"description": "They eat, they heal, they breathe, they mate. You, on the other hand, do not. If only you could take the life of others and use it for yourself.\n \nYou have a barrier of up to 40 souls that recharges when you kill a mob. While this barrier exists, you can not die, and any instance of damage, big or small, will remove 1 soul from your barrier."
